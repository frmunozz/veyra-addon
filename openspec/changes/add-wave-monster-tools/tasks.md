## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Detect wave pages via `.monster-card` entries, known wave URLs, or `#toggleDeadBtn`; extract monster names/ids, and render a floating (top-right, toggleable) multi-select filter that hides non-selected cards, persists per wave page, and is shared between alive/dead views (closed label 🛠️, open label 🛠️ Wave filters and loot 🛠️).
- [x] 1.2 When `hide_dead_monsters=0`, show bulk loot controls (count input default 5) inside the floating menu; run sequential loot on visible monsters only with ~500ms spacing, filter controls locked during the run, and a floating progress indicator.
- [x] 1.3 Aggregate loot responses into a single modal summarizing rewards/items (stacking by `ITEM_ID`) after bulk loot, counting failures and including them in the summary; show per-monster loot modal on direct Loot clicks and close modals via X or backdrop.
- [x] 1.4 Replace dead monster card CTA with side-by-side Quick loot/View buttons aligned within the parent; Quick loot issues form-encoded POSTs to `loot.php` including `monster_id` and `user_id`; disable the floating menu toggle and `#openBattleDrawerBtn` while either menu is open to prevent overlap.
- [x] 1.5 Add a footer toggle to flip `hide_dead_monsters` (show dead vs alive) and reload; when dead are hidden, bulk controls show only the unavailable message. Implement the wave monster UI/logic in dedicated content/CSS files (e.g., `wave-monster-tools.js` and `wave-monster-tools.css`), scoped to wave pages via manifest, keep styling prefixed `veyra-addon-*`, ensure logs use `[Veyra Addon]`, and update `docs/README.md` with observed endpoints/flows.
- [x] 1.6 Validate specs with `openspec validate add-wave-monster-tools --strict` and fix any findings.
