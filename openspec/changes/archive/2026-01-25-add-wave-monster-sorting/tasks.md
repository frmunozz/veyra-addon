## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add a sort selector to the Wave Tools panel on wave pages and wire it to localStorage per wave page.
- [x] 1.2 Parse HP/current and HP/max from each monster card, sort the DOM by the selected mode, and preserve original order on ties.
- [x] 1.3 Keep filter selections/visibility intact when sorting; update the docs to mention the new sort control.
- [x] 1.4 Manual validation: load a wave page, confirm default order, switch among sort modes, refresh, and confirm the selection persists.
