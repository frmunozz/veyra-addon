## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Update the wave automation dropdown to include "All monsters" (value "") and allow it to be selected and persisted.
- [x] 1.2 Adjust enable/run validation to treat the empty value as valid when it maps to the "All monsters" option in `#fNameSel`.
- [x] 1.3 Update automation status/error messaging and document the "All monsters" behavior in `docs/README.md`.
- [x] 1.4 Manual validation: on a wave page with QOL controls, select "All monsters", enable automation, confirm the sequence runs, and reload to verify persistence.
